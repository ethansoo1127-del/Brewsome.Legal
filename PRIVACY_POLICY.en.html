    <p><span class="highlight">In Short:</span> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</span></p>
    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Consent.</span> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose.

        <li><span class="highlight">Legitimate Interests.</span> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. Examples of our legitimate business interests are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>Analyzing how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</li>
                <li>Diagnosing problems and/or preventing fraudulent activities</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Legal Obligations.</span> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Vital Interests.</span> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
        <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
        <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
        <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
        <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
        <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
        <li>If it is reasonable to expect obtaining consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
        <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
        <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
        <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>

    <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>
    
    <p>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:</p>
    <p>We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p>
    
    <h2 id="how-long-keep"><span class="section-number">6.</span> HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">In Short:</span> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
    
    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 6 months.</p>
    
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
    
    <h2 id="how-keep-safe"><span class="section-number">7.</span> HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">In Short:</span> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
    
    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access our Services within a secure environment.</p>
    
    <h2 id="privacy-rights"><span class="section-number">8.</span> WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">In Short:</span> Depending on where you are located geographically, the applicable privacy law may mean you have greater rights with regard to your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>
    
    <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "<a href="#contact" class="contact-email">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>" below.</p>
    
    <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
    
    <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" class="contact-email" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a></p>
    
    <p>If you are located in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html" class="contact-email" target="_blank">https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html</a></p>
    
    <h3>Withdrawing your consent</h3>
    <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "<a href="#contact" class="contact-email">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>" below.</p>
    
    <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
    
    <h3>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications</h3>
    <p>You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section "<a href="#contact" class="contact-email">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>" below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">Cookies and similar technologies:</span> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.</p>
    
    <h2 id="do-not-track"><span class="section-number">9.</span> CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
    
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
    
    <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there isn't an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don't respond to them at this time.</p>
    
    <h2 id="california-residents"><span class="section-number">10.</span> DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>

More information is provided below.</p>

If you use an authorized agent to exercise your rights, we may deny a request if the authorized agent does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf.</p>
    
    <h3>Request Verification</h3>
    <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>
    
    <p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>
    
    <p>If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity before processing your request and may require that you confirm that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.</p>

    <h2 id="children-privacy"><span class="section-number">15.</span> DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">In Short:</span> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 13 years of age. Our Services are designed to be privacy-first, especially for minors.</p>
    
    <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 13 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 13 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services.</p>
    
    <p>We have designed our Services to minimize data collection and protect all users. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Our Services <span class="highlight">do not contain</span> third-party advertising or behavioral tracking.</li>
        <li>Core features involving user content (such as access to the <span class="highlight">Camera</span> or <span class="highlight">Photo Library</span>) are processed <span class="highlight">locally on your device only</span>. We <span class="highlight">do not</span> collect, upload, or view your photos or videos.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The only way we might unknowingly collect personal information from a child under 13 is if they voluntarily send us a support request via our feedback email. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 (for example, via an email) without parental consent, we will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hi@brewsome.coffee" class="contact-email">hi@brewsome.coffee</a> so that we can take the necessary actions.</p>
